abstract: Researchers from Basel and Zurich are creating a high-â€‹resolution atlas that depicts the development of the human retina. One technique they use is a new method that allows them to visualise more than 50 proteins simultaneously.
notes: Very cool! The atlas could support research to halt the progression of a degenerative eye disease that can cause people lose their sight.
