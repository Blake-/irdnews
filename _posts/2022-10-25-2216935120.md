abstract: "Age-related macular degeneration, Stargardt disease, and their Abca4-/- mouse modelare characterized by accelerated accumulation of the pigment lipofuscin, derived from photoreceptor disc turnover in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE); lipofuscin accumulation and retinal degeneration both occur earlier in albino mice. Intravitreal injectionof superoxide (O2•–) generators reverses lipofuscin accumulation and rescues retinalpathology, but neither the target nor mechanism is known. Here we show that RPEcontains thin multi-lamellar membranes (TLMs) resembling photoreceptor discs, which associate with melanolipofuscin granules in pigmented mice but in albinos are 10-fold more abundant and reside in vacuoles. Genetically over-expressing tyrosinase in albinos generates melanosomes and decreases TLM-related lipofuscin. Intravitreal injection of generators of O2•– or nitric oxide (•NO) decreases TLM-related lipofuscin in melanolipofuscin granules of pigmented mice by ~50% in 2 d, but not in albinos. Prompted by evidence that O2•– plus •NO creates a dioxetane on melanin that excites its electrons to a high-energy state (termed “chemiexcitation”), we show that exciting electrons directly using a synthetic dioxetane reverses TLM-related lipofuscin even in albinos; quenching the excited-electron energy blocks this reversal. Melanin chemiexcitation assists in safe photoreceptor disc turnover."
notes: "Regarding basic science, we report a physical chemistry mechanism involved in turnover of spent photoreceptor discs, a process essential for reusing retinal and preventing lipofuscin that leads to age-related macular degeneration. We show that melanin in the retinal pigmentepithelium is required for turnover and that turnover is enhanced by chemical excitationof electrons, a quantum chemistry phenomenon termed “chemiexcitation.” Regarding molecular medicine, we report that lipofuscin is removed from eye explants of the preclinical mouse model using a chemical that excites electrons directly. This circumvents the dependence on melanin, which varies between individuals and is less effective with age. Chemiexcitation also explains an array of known treatments that decrease ocular lipofuscin in what we show is a melanin-dependent way"
