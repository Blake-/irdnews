abstract: Electrophysiological tests are crucial in managing inherited retinal disorders (IRDs) such as cone dystrophies and macular dystrophies. These tests, including ffERG and EOG, help identify specific dysfunctions in photoreceptors, allowing for early diagnosis and classification of conditions like cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response and Stargardt disease. They also differentiate between various dystrophies and guide treatment strategies, providing valuable information for monitoring disease progression and confirming genetic mutations. Overall, they enhance the clinical and genetic characterization of IRDs.
