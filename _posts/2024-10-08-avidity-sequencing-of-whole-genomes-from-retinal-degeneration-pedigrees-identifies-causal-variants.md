abstract: The study employs avidity sequencing to analyze genomes from retinal degeneration pedigrees, identifying causal variants associated with the condition. By examining genetic data, researchers uncover links between specific variants and retinal disorders, enhancing the understanding of hereditary retinal diseases. This approach may improve genetic testing and inform future therapeutic strategies.
