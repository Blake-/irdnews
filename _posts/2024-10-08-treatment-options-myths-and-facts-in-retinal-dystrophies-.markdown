Retinal dystrophies are genetic disorders characterized by the degeneration of retinal photoreceptors, leading to vision loss. They are classified into rod-cone, cone-rod, and macular dystrophies, each affecting different cell types. Treatment options include pharmacological agents like carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, gene therapies (e.g., Luxturna for LCA), optogenetics for late-stage cases, and stem cell therapies. Immunotherapy and low vision aids can also help. Myths surrounding these conditions include the belief that all dystrophies cause total blindness or are progressive.
