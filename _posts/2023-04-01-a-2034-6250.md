abstract: Our findings confirm a heterogeneity in clinical presentation associated with pathogenic variants in PRPH2. It may follow either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and show a very heterogeneous clinical manifestation of retinal degeneration, e.g., autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (♂ sibling; II-3) and autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (index ♀ sibling; II-2), autosomal dominant macular dystrophy, and also autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.
notes: Interesting because brother/sister siblings.
