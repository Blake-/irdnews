abstract: Deep-intronic (DI) variants represent approximately 10-12% of disease-causing genetic defects 26 in ABCA4-associated Stargardt disease (STGD1). Although many of these DI variants are 27 amenable to antisense oligonucleotide-based splicing modulation therapy, no treatment is 28 currently available. These molecules are mostly variant-specific, limiting their applicability to 29 a broader patient population. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the 30 CRISPR-Cas9 system combined with the amphipathic lipopeptide C18 1-LAH5 for 31 intracellular delivery to correct splicing defects caused by different DI variants within the same 32 intron. The combination of these components facilitated efficient editing of two target introns 33 (introns 30 and 36) of ABCA4 in which several recurrent DI variants are found. The partial 34 removal of these introns did not affect ABCA4 splicing or its expression levels when assessed 35 in two different human cellular models fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 36 photoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs). Furthermore, the DNA editing in STGD1 patient-derived 37 PPCs led to a ~50% reduction of the pseudoexon-containing transcripts resulting from the 38 c.4539+2001G>A variant in intron 30. Overall, we provide proof-of-concept evidence of the 39 use of C18 1-LAH5 as a delivery system for therapeutic genome editing for ABCA4-associated 40 DI variants, offering new opportunities Journal Pre-proof for clinical translation.
