title: "Monitoring Lesion Area Progression in Stargardt Disease: A Comparison of En Face Optical Coherence Tomography and Fundus Autofluorescence"
original_url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37126335/
abstract: To compare longitudinal changes in en face spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) measurements of ellipsoid zone (EZ) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) loss to changes in the hypoautofluorescent and hyperautofluorescent (AF) areas detected with short-wavelength (SW)-AF in ABCA4-associated retinopathy.
notes: The findings are relevant to the selection of outcome measures for monitoring ABCA4-associated retinopathy.
