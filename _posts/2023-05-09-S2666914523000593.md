title: Multimodal phenomap of Stargardt disease integrating structural, psychophysical, and electrophysiologic measures of retinal degeneration
original_url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666914523000593
abstract: Reflecting the phenotypic complexity of STGD, an unsupervised clustering approach incorporating multimodal phenotypic measures can be used to categorize STGD eyes into several distinct phenotypic clusters. The clusters exhibit differences in structural and functional measures including quantity of flecks, extent of retinal atrophy, visual fixation accuracy, and ERG responses, among other features. If novel pharmacologic, gene, or cell therapy modalities become available in the future, the multimodal phenomap approach may be useful to individualize treatment decisions, and its utility in aiding prognostication requires further evaluation.
